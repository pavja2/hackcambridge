## Inspiration

Brightboard is about using technology to make learning magical. We set out to transform the classroom experience from simple passive engagement with a lecture into a magical "living in the future" moment - one that makes learning more effective and encourages discovery.

Brightboard hides a lot of incredible technology behind an intuitive and simply user interface. It transforms data into knowledge without requiring the student to do anything other than explore what they love the most. With the help of Cisco's Spark, it creates a community of knowledge with incentives to share and discuss discoveries - both in the classroom and beyond.

In short, Britghtboard is a new vision for how to learn in a connected age - we have more information at our disposal than ever before but making those critical associations with what we learn in class is still far too difficult.
